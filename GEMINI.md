## Workflow for Feature Implementation

When a new feature is requested, the following step-by-step process will be followed:

1.  **User Feature Request**
2.  **Agent's Overall Implementation Plan (Code Excluded):** The agent will present a high-level, step-by-step plan for the entire feature, without providing any code.
3.  **User-Agent Feature Discussion/Agreement:** The user and agent will discuss and agree upon the overall feature implementation plan.
4.  **Agent's Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation (Code Excluded):** Once the overall plan is agreed upon, the agent will provide a detailed explanation for each individual step, still without providing any code.
5.  **User-Agent Detailed Step Discussion/Agreement:** The user and agent will discuss and agree upon the details of the specific step.
6.  **Agent's Code Proposal (For Current Step):** Only after the detailed explanation for a step is agreed upon, the agent will provide the actual code for that specific step.
